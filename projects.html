    <h1>My Projects and Learnings</h1>

    <p class="intro">Projects are fundamental for personal and professional development, as they drive the learning of new skills, both individual and group, and enhance existing knowledge. So far, I've had the chance to apply this importance in practice by developing two games.</p>

    <h2>Clean Tig: The First Collaborative Challenge</h2>
    <p>My first project was the game "Clean Tig", created on the Bitsy platform. The objective was simple but engaging: to clean a building after a party to prevent the main character from being grounded. Developed in a group, we relied on the platform's intuitive tutorials, which facilitated the process. Although it was a challenging experience, being the first time doing something like this, the final result was very rewarding for the entire team.</p>

    <h2>Silent Hunt: "Phygital" Innovation and Accessibility</h2>
    <p>The second project, "Silent Hunt" (Busca Silenciosa), represented a significant milestone. My group and I had the mission to build a "phygital" (physical-digital) game focused on accessibility, specifically for people with hearing impairments. The idea was to promote light and intriguing social integration, maintaining principles of competitiveness, mystery, and intuition in interactions between people with and without disabilities. To achieve this, we adapted the traditional game "Blind Man's Bluff" to cater to non-oral deaf individuals who do not understand spoken Portuguese.</p>

    <p>The great differential of "Silent Hunt" lies in its innovative mechanics. The searching player, called the "Hunter", uses a vest equipped with an ESP32, a protoboard, and a vibrating motor. These technologies enable the controlled emission of gradual vibrations, which indicate the proximity of the closest hiding participant. Thus, the Hunter relies on their intuition and directional tests to continue the "silent hunt" for the "Fugitives," transforming the game into an accessible and sensorially rich experience.</p>

    <p>Both projects were essential experiences that not only solidified my technical learning but also reinforced the importance of collaboration, creativity, and social impact in technology development. I'm eager to apply these lessons in future projects and continue exploring new possibilities!</p>
