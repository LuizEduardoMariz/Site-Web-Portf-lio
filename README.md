## About Me

Hi, I'm **Luiz Eduardo Mariz**, an enthusiastic student at CESAR School, eager to tackle new challenges and grow into a leading professional in technology. I'm constantly learning and refining my skills. Beyond coding, I'm passionate about football and playing the guitar, hobbies that foster my discipline and creativity.

I'm particularly interested in **software development**, and this portfolio demonstrates my dedication to creating projects that are not only functional but also solve problems and deliver value through innovative approaches.

## Inspirations

My journey into technology is deeply rooted in two significant influences: the discipline learned through sports and the unwavering support of my family.

### The Discipline of Sports in Technology

Sports have instilled in me valuable lessons directly applicable to the tech world:

* **Consistency and Resilience:** Just like in sports, continuous practice and perseverance are crucial for solving complex problems in technology.
* **Continuous Improvement:** The drive to always learn and adapt to new scenarios mirrors the dynamic nature of the tech industry.
* **Teamwork:** Collaboration is a cornerstone of both sports and software development. Listening to colleagues, sharing knowledge, and celebrating collective achievements are vital.

### Family Support: The Foundation

My family has been my constant source of encouragement and confidence. Their unconditional support allowed me to take risks, learn from mistakes, and persist through challenges. Their belief in me, even when the path was uncertain, has been a significant motivator.

## Projects

Projects are essential for learning and skill development. Here are two games I've developed, demonstrating my practical application of technical knowledge and teamwork.

### 1. Clean Tig: The First Collaborative Challenge

* **Platform:** Bitsy
* **Objective:** Clean a building after a party to prevent the main character from being grounded.
* **Key Learnings:** This group project was my first experience developing a game. It provided valuable insights into collaborative work and utilizing platform tutorials.

### 2. Silent Hunt ("Busca Silenciosa"): "Phygital" Innovation and Accessibility

* **Concept:** A "phygital" (physical-digital) game designed for accessibility, specifically for people with hearing impairments.
* **Adaptation:** A reimagining of the traditional "Blind Man's Bluff" game for non-oral deaf individuals who don't understand spoken Portuguese.
* **Innovative Mechanics:**
    * The "Hunter" player wears a vest equipped with an **ESP32**, a **protoboard**, and a **vibrating motor**.
    * The vibrating motor emits **gradual vibrations** to indicate the proximity of the closest hiding participant.
    * This allows the Hunter to rely on intuition and directional cues for a "silent hunt," creating an accessible and sensorially rich experience.
* **Key Learnings:** This project significantly reinforced the importance of collaboration, creativity, and developing technology with a social impact.
